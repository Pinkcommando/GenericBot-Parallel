Generic functions should be split into two classes

- WizWalkerUtilities: A library of functions for wizwalker
- GenericFucntions: A library of function wrappers for WizWalkerUtilities (include auto-timeout?)

weird glitch with bot stopping after reset, and during combat?
consider better concurrency by putting each client on its own thread
handle timeouts in the functions library rather than in the bot classes
